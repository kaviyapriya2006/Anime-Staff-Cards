# Anime-Staff-Cards

I made these cute little profile cards for anime images (♡) as a fun way to test out all the CSS properties I've been learning. And guess what? I didn't expect it to turn out this adorable, haha!😄

What's inside?

* Responsive Design: I've used media queries to make sure it looks great on all screen sizes.
* Cute Anime Vibes: Well I don't have to explain this one!!!
* Simple yet Adorable: I kept it simple, but the result is just too cute to handle!

Why I did this

I was just playing around with CSS, trying to see how everything works together. This project was supposed to be a quick test, but I ended up loving it so much 😊.
